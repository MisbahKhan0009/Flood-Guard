## 🌊 Flood Guard Project Overview

Bangladesh is a country highly vulnerable to floods. Every year, it faces mild to severe floods, leading to significant loss of life and financial damage. If there were a way to predict floods in advance, it would help mitigate these losses. 

In this project, **Flood Guard**, we aim to develop a website that can forecast floods ahead of time. The site will assist flood victims in finding safe shelters and enable rescuers to provide them with food, medical supplies, and other forms of support. It will include a navigation system, allowing both victims and rescuers to easily find the quickest route to the nearest flood shelter. 

We will use location-based forecasting and strive for the highest accuracy to ensure the maximum number of lives are saved. Additionally, we will integrate a mapping system to display the status of mobile towers near the user’s location. A prediction system will also be included to help rescuers estimate the necessary amount of food and medicine.
